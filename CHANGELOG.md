# Changelog

## 2026-04-13

- Fix in-memory link consistency after `gwt_link`: newly created bidirectional links now update already-loaded buffer/workspace `MemoryItem` instances in the same session so the next competition round sees the new graph.
- Added regressions for live object link sync and multi-hop competition after linking.
